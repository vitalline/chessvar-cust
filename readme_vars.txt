A collection of custom chess variants that can be played by loading a JSON save file.

Unpack "assets" and "vars" next to the chessvar executables to install the required files.
Optionally, rename "vars" to whatever you want and point the config variable "load_path" to it.
Note that "assets" should be kept as is, next to the executables, or no custom sprites will display.

To select a variant save file to load, use the hotkey Alt + Shift + L.
(In some cases, the file picker window may display below the active one.)
Changing "load_path" updates the initial path to display in the file picker.

Note that there may be some variants that aren't fun to play, and some that may not be fully tested.
Generally, the more complex a variant is, the more likely it is to randomly break after an app update.
Exercise caution - and don't forget to save your move logs and game data if you want it to be preserved.

But above all, have fun!
